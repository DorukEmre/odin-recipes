    <p>This easy overnight pancake casserole is a great option for a breakfast on Christmas morning! The pancakes absorb the custardy mixture, resulting in a bread pudding-like consistency. The crunchy streusel topping is a nice contrast. Serve with plenty of warm maple syrup and hot coffee or cold milk.</p>
